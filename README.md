# UserFinder

### Description
Imagine that you have just found a login page that returns different error messages depending on whether the username exists or not.
For example, "Invalid Credentials" if the username doesn't exist and "Invalid login" if it does (but the password is wrong)

If you are in this ***extremely*** specific scenario, this tool is what you need.

### Usage

Pretty straightforward, just look at UserFinder.py -h  
For info, it's based on the *requests* module and was tested on Python3

I will absolutely **not** keep it updated so hopefully it works as needed for you too
